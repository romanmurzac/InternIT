# Models of Data Processing - ETL/ELT
This chapter introduces interns to the two primary models of data processing: **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**. Interns will implement a simplified ETL pipeline using Python scripts to simulate real-world data workflows.

## To Do List
* Run extraction scripts to collect data from all three sources.
* Use transformation scripts to clean and model the data.
* Load the transformed data into PostgreSQL tables.
* Validate the pipeline by querying the final tables.
* Document the ETL process.

## Extract
Data is extracted from three different sources and stored in the raw layer of the data warehouse.

**internit_data**\
To extract data for `internit_data` table use the code from `src/extract/internit.py` file.

**exchange_data**\
To extract data for `exchange_data` table use the code from `src/extract/exchange.py` file.

**xe_data**\
To extract data for `xe_data` table use the code from `src/extract/xe.py` file.

## Transform
Data is cleaned, normalized, and structured into analytical models such as dimensions and fact tables.

To transform data for `dim_currency`, `dim_rate`, `dim_user`, and `fact_transaction` tables use the code from `src/transform/transformer.py` file.

## Load
Transformed data is loaded into the trusted layer of the internit_db warehouse for reporting and analytics.

To load data from `staging` to `trusted` layer use the code from `src/load/loader.py` file.
